It affects various parameters of the body such as cardiovascular, respiratory, thermal, and metabolic which in turn have an influence on exercise physiology.[9] There are four main phases of a menstrual cycle: the early follicular phase, ovulation phase, and mid-luteal phase. The early follicular phase is characterised by low oestrogen and low progesterone phase. The ovulatory phase is characterised by high oestrogen and low progesterone phase. The mid-luteal phase has high oestrogen and high progesterone level. It is further classified into early follicular phase, late follicular phase, ovulation, early luteal, mid-luteal, and late-luteal phase.\n\nStudies have shown that the performance of exercises was reduced in the follicular phase due to low levels of oestrogen and progesterone. Oestrogen has anabolic effects and restores the glycogen stores. It even acts as an antioxidant and membrane stabiliser hence it helps against exercise-induced muscle damage and reduces inflammatory responses. It has neuroexcitatory effects where it activates voluntary activation and reduces inhibition. Therefore when the oestrogen rises in other menstrual phases the performance of exercises improves. There is reduction of maximal endurance in the mid-luteal phase as per one study.\n\nProgesterone has anti-oestrogenic effects. Hence when the oestrogen effects are high in the ovulatory phase and late follicular phase, the performance is at its peak as there is no interference from progesterone.\n\nWhile some studies have reported a decrease in physical performance in the early follicular phase, other studies have found no significant changes in overall physical performance. For instance, a narrative review of athletes' perceived and objectively measured performance shows that: Female athletes believe their performance is slightly lower in the early follicular and late luteal phase. However, results based on objectively measured performance (with aerobic, anaerobic, and strength-related assessments) do not indicate that menstrual cycle phases have a significant impact on physical performance.  As a result, the impact of the menstrual cycle on physical performance is still debated.",

In 2012 Shultz found that \"there was a direct relationship between the high oestrogen level and ACL injury, the knee laxity increased in direct relation to elevations in plasma estradiol levels.

This consideration is due to the inhibitory effect of oestrogen on collagen synthesis. However, the results are conflicting. There are some studies report that \"any increase in oestrogen is not great enough to have a significant impact on collagen density\".\n\nIn professional soccer, the rate of women suffered from muscle strains was 54% lower than males along with the tendon injury but they were at a higher risk of ligament injury and this was more related to the level of oestrogen.\nA recent study that measured the flexibility of hamstring and muscle strength during the menstrual cycle in healthy young females found that; there was a significant increase in the range of motion and passive torque during the ovulatory and luteal phase and the passive stiffness decreased significantly during the ovulatory phase.

Different medical and non-medical treatments are proven to reduce the symptoms such as taking NSAIDs, herbal diet therapies, yoga, meditation, and acupressure.\n\nMild to moderate exercises/physical activities help in controlling the symptoms of dysmenorrhoea. According to the intensity of exercise it was stated that \"moderate –high-intensity exercise was believed to increase the anti-inflammatory cytokines, decrease the overall amount of prostaglandins released because of the decrease of over the all amount of menstrual flow and low-intensity exercise reduces the cortisol level and prostaglandin synthesis\".In overall exercises release endorphins which increase the pain threshold and improve the mood of exercising subjects. It reduces the consumption of drugs and the length of menstruation pain. It even promotes positive thoughts and distracts intrusive thoughts.\n\nThere are different approaches to treating primary dysmenorrhoea. This includes NSAIDS or contraceptive medicines, but there are numerous side effects of these medications due to which nonpharmacological treatments like physiotherapy are preferred. Stretching techniques and isometric exercises help in this condition. Kegel exercises, jogging, and relaxation exercises are effective.
